# STM32videos

This repository holds code and Makefiles that are used for each video. Check out the video for explanation.
I am making these videos with STM32f4 DISCOVERY board with STM32f407IG processor. Most facst and almost all 
functions are compatible on other processors, just make sure to read datasheet and reference manual to 
find and adapt changes.

I have also added a template folder with all files needed besides the library, that you should download
and store separate.

It is also expected (explained all in VIDEO 1) that you have ARM GCC compiler installed, st-link utility 
and stlib from ST somewhere on your drive, I recommend in a folder (mine is Embedded) on your /HOME.
